/**
 * Parse worker pool — runs tree-sitter parsing across N worker threads so a full
 * `codegraph index` uses every core instead of pinning one.
 *
 * Why this exists: `ExtractionOrchestrator.indexAll()` already reads files in
 * parallel, but it parsed them through a SINGLE worker thread, so on an
 * N-core machine indexing a large repo used one core and left the rest idle
 * (issue #1015, the parse-time half of #320). Spreading the parse calls across a
 * pool of workers — each its own tree-sitter WASM heap — restores multi-core
 * throughput. SQLite storage stays on the main thread (it isn't thread-safe), so
 * only the CPU-bound parse step is parallelised; results are stored as they
 * arrive, in whatever order they finish.
 *
 * Design mirrors {@link ../mcp/query-pool} (idle-list dispatch, lazy growth,
 * throttled cold-starts, crash recovery), with parse-specific behaviour:
 *   - per-worker recycle: WASM linear memory grows but never shrinks, so each
 *     worker is torn down and replaced after `recycleInterval` parses to reclaim
 *     its heap — the same reason the old single worker recycled.
 *   - reject, don't retry: a parse that crashes or times out its worker REJECTS
 *     (with a message the orchestrator's retry pass recognises) rather than being
 *     silently requeued — the orchestrator owns the smarter two-stage retry
 *     (fresh worker, then comment-stripped) on a clean WASM heap.
 *   - a size-1 pool reproduces the old single-worker path exactly, which is the
 *     conservative rollback: set `CODEGRAPH_PARSE_WORKERS=1`.
 *
 * Memory: peak scales with pool size (≈ size × a worker's pre-recycle heap), so
 * the default is capped and the env var lets constrained machines dial it down.
